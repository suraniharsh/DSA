## 🧑‍💻 Fundamentals of Programming

> **Overview:**
> This module forms the bedrock of all programming and problem-solving. It focuses on writing syntactically correct and logically sound code, understanding how computers interpret instructions, and preparing your brain for more complex constructs in data structures and algorithms.

---

### 🎯 **Objectives**

* Develop a solid grasp of basic programming constructs.
* Write clean, readable, and bug-free code.
* Understand how data is stored, manipulated, and controlled via logic.
* Build confidence to solve beginner-level coding problems and implement simple applications.

---

### 📚 **Topics Covered**

#### ✅ 1. Input & Output

* Taking user input/output via console
* Formatting output (tabs, newlines, precision)
* ASCII values and basic character encoding

#### ✅ 2. Variables, Data Types, and Operators

* Integer, Float, Char, Boolean
* Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Bitwise operators
* Type conversion (implicit/explicit)

#### ✅ 3. Conditional Statements

* `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` blocks
* Nested conditionals
* Use cases like grading systems, billing logic, etc.

#### ✅ 4. Loops

* `for`, `while`, `do-while`
* Infinite loops, loop counters, breaking/continuing execution
* Nested loops (for pattern printing, simple simulation problems)

#### ✅ 5. Functions & Recursion

* Modularizing code using functions
* Call by value vs call by reference
* Recursion basics and call stack trace

#### ✅ 6. Arrays & Strings (Intro)

* Declaration, initialization, traversal
* Basic string operations (concatenation, comparison, length)
* Multi-dimensional arrays (basic intro)

#### ✅ 7. Pointers (Optional, but Recommended)

* Basics of memory address handling
* Use cases in functions and arrays

### 📌 **Pre-requisites**

* Absolutely none. This is your starting point.
* A basic understanding of how computers work (optional but helpful).

---

### 🛠️ Tools You Can Use

* **Languages**: C, C++, Python (any general-purpose language works)
* **IDE**: VS Code, CodeBlocks, Turbo C++ (if you’re a masochist), or online judges like HackerRank, LeetCode
